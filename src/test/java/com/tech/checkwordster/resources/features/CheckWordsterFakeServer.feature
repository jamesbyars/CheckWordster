Feature: CheckWordsterFake

  For the hipster bank customer
  Who is unhappy with traditional bank check issuing services, because the checks written donâ€™t have that retro feel,
  The CheckWordster is a microservice of a bank check writing service
  That provides the words for the amounts on a check that used to be written by people.
  Unlike ECPS (Enterprise Check Production System),
  Our product gives checks that old time feeling, with amounts in both numbers and words.

  Scenario: Start server
    Given I start the "fake" server

  Scenario Outline: Convert numbers into words when all goes well
    When I convert "<number>" into words
    Then it should be "<words>"

    Examples:
      |number       |words                                                                                                                                 |
